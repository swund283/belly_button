# belly_button
Fun module this week.  interactive dashboard with a few key functions.  takes in an argument, the value of the person, which is from a pre-populated list.  then runs that value through 2 main functions; one to populate the demographic info and one to populate the three graphs.  This all occours through a webpage hosted on github - though it would be easy to host in many places.

hope you like my custom guage color choices.
